**NexusTimer** is an app designed for tracking your training sessions on the Rubik's Cube, with a user interface inspired by [Twisty Timer](https://github.com/aricneto/TwistyTimer) to provide a comparable desktop experience.

## About The Project

For those new to speedcubing, it's a challenge where cubers aim to solve the Rubik's Cube as quickly as possible. Currently, the world record stands at 3.05 seconds (55.08% faster than the video below by [Feliks Zemdegs](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2009ZEMD01) üòÅ).

## Key Features

### Metrics by Cube

The "Category Aggregation Principle" allows you to analyze statistics not just for individual categories but also for each individual cube within the same category without affecting overall calculations.

### Comprehensive Solve Tracking

Track all your solves with detailed statistics, including DNF (Did Not Finish) tracking, penalties, and personal bests.

### Advanced Statistics

Analyze your performance with detailed statistics including averages (ao5, ao12, etc.), best times, and trends over time.

### Multiple Timer Modes

Choose between normal timer mode and Stackmat timer mode to match your preferred solving setup.

### Scramble Visualization

View scramble images to help you understand the scramble before solving, with options to zoom in for better visibility.

### Cross and X-Cross Solutions

Get hints for cross and x-cross solutions to help improve your solving techniques (for 3x3 cubes).

### Customizable Interface

Personalize your experience with features like scramble images, session statistics, quick action buttons, and more.

### Portability

Import and export your data from other popular timers such as csTimer, Twisty Timer, and CubeDesk!
