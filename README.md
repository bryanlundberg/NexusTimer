## About The Project

For those new to speedcubing, it's a puzzle-solving challenge where cubers aim to solve the Rubik's Cube as quickly as possible. The objective is to align all the cube's colors correctly while racing against the clock for the fastest solve time. Achieving a fast solve time is the goal.

## Overview

This timer is carefully designed to keep track of solving times, giving valuable information and making the speedcubing experience even better. It's an essential tool for speedcubers who appreciate quality.

## What's the difference?

### Cool Stats
We like to find interesting data about you by extracting meaning from your training sessions, not like a conventional timer. This process often unveils insights you may not have even been aware of. 

### Metrics by cube or method
We have included what I called the **"Category Aggregation Principle."** To empower speedcubers to compute and analyze statistics not just for individual categories but also for each individual cube within the same category without affect or modify overall calculations. 

### No DNF
Who likes? We won't cover calculations using DNF, instead delete the solve or add you a +2 penalty.

### Portability
While our primary focus is on delivering an optimal experience for desktop training, we are actively striving to extend this functionality to cater to the needs of mobile users.

### Modern design
Our UI is heavily inspired by Twisty Timer, the ultimate timer on mobile category. However, we've added more features, with even more on the way.

This is what makes unique and versatile **Nexus Timer**.
